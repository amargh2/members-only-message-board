## About this project

This is a message board web app modeled loosely after Reddit/Twitter and built with Express. I used Pug for the templating engine and handwritten SASS for the CSS.

The main goal of this project was to learn more about authentication and authorization, and to get better with routes, controllers, and database operations in general. 

I decided to add a messaging system (currently just one-to-one communication) as an additional little challenge.
